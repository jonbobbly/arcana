# Intro

Project arcana is a series of data files and behaviors that 
come together to make a game. The reference implementation 
is written in Python.

# Data Files

All the data for the world of project arcana is held in a 
folder conveniently named 'data'.

## Directory Tree

In the data folder are the following sub folders:

- arcana
- areas
- items
- moves
- npcs
- ui

## JSON

All of the data files are json files and should end with the 
.json extension.

### Arcana Definitions

### Individual Arcana

### Moves

### Locations (Areas)

### Items

### NPCs

### UI

The general interface is loaded from this folder so that it 
might be "easy" to translate the game to other languages.
